# Swirl 2018 - Subject React

# Subject

## Description

## Usage
Use yarn preferably.




### Front-end ('front' folder)

#### Where to look




### Back-end ('back' folder)

#### Where to look

### Important Note
The back-end, which is not the real point of the subject, has been done quickly.
The back-end integrity is not guaranteed (no user field check).
Message sent need to be non-explicit.
The JSON file based 'database', made for rookies to avoid setup and connection to real databases engines,
may cause some unexpected behaviours, especially on concurrent accesses.
The code needs a serious refactor too.
